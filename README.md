概述

* When we drive a car, we look at the road with our eyes. The lane line on the road is our general reference for driving. Therefore, one of the primary tasks of automatic driving technology is to develop visual algorithm to determine the lane line on the road.

* In this project, Python and opencv will be used to detect the lane line in the image. Opencv is the abbreviation of "open source computer vision", which has been widely used in the field of image analysis and processing.

* The program code file is p1.ipynb, and the project report file is writeup template.md.
